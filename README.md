# QR Code Analysis and Processing
#Overview

This project provides tools for analyzing, processing, and manipulating QR code images using various image processing techniques. The functionalities include loading images, applying transformations, removing noise, detecting QR code structures, and decoding messages embedded within the QR codes.

#Main process

*Load images from Google Drive

*Apply various preprocessing techniques

*Analyze QR code structure and extract the coded messages.


#late Update 

we finished the decoding of 12/16 test cases 100% correct , added some geniric functionalities to the hoal code and adjusted the decoder to handel modes of the qr code v1 .
the file  *Final_Final_Late.ipynb* contains  the last work we did 




we started by working on each test case indivualy to make the data extraction easier , the eairly virson of our code is located in *CV_Shgall.ipynb* file which includes eirly prosccing steps , and eairly decoder sample .

In *working_not_generic.ipynb* file we added som extincive preprocessing on each test case , and in the decoder part we tried alot of modifications and adjustments. some of them reached a dead end but finaly we manged to decod 9/16 testcases perfectly 100% , in the test cases that didnt work , we hade an idea on how to make them work but due to time scrample we couldint finish them. 


*Final_V.ipynb* files is our very late attempt to make the code as geniric as possiple and we hade alot in mind but agin not coplete because of deadline.

Finaly there will be a demo video on how every thing works ,what abroaches did we take and what we had in mind.
